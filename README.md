# DslRobotMl
We will create own version of RoboML, a language to define the behavior of a small robot. Building the DSL will include modeling the domain, and implements the associated tooling: e.g. the text editor and its services, an interpreter (through a web-based simulator) and a compiler (to Arduino code that will run on the robot itself).
